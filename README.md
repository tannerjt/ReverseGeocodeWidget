##Reverse Geocoding Widget
ESRI has released their Web App Builder for developers to BETA test.  One of the most advantageous features is the ability to create and share custom widgets.  This widget can be packaged with your app and used to reverse geocode an address from a map click.

#Instructions
1. Download this widget and place it into your widgets folder (client/stemapp/widgets)
2. Add widget to your application and use builder to set new GeocodeServer URL

##Service is currently set to an Oregon geocoder and will only work within the state.

#Changes
Feel free to make any improvements to this widget and I will take a look.  It's pretty simple right now, but works for a starter.
