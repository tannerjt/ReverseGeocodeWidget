##Reverse Geocoding Widget
ESRI has released their Web App Builder for developers to BETA test.  One of the most advantageous features is the ability to create and share custom widgets.  This widget can be packaged with your app and used to reverse geocode an address from a map click.

#Instructions
1. Change the geocodeURL to your own if needed.  This one is for Oregon.
2. In your application config JSON file, add the location where you downloaded the widget.

#Changes
Feel free to make any improvements to this widget and I will take a look.  It's pretty simple right now, but works for a starter.
